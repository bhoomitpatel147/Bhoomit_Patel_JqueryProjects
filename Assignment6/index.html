                            6, 1963) is an American computer security consultant, author,
                            and
                            convicted hacker. He is best known for his high-profile 1995 arrest and five years in prison
                            for
                            various computer and communications-related crimes.</p>
                        <p>Mitnick's pursuit, arrest, trial, and sentence along with the associated journalism, books,
                            and
                            films
                            were all controversial.</p>
                        <p>He now runs the security firm Mitnick Security Consulting, LLC. He is also the Chief Hacking
                            Officer
                            and part owner of the security awareness training company KnowBe4, as well as an active
                            advisory

                        <h2>Hacking History:</h2>
                        <p>At age 12, Mitnick got a bus driver to tell him where he could buy his own ticket punch for
                            "a
                            school
                            project", and was then able to ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused transfer
                            slips
                            he
                            found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage.</p>
                        <p>Mitnick first gained unauthorized access to a computer network in 1979, at 16, when a friend
                            gave
                            him
                            the phone number for the Ark, the computer system that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)
                            used
                            for
                            developing its RSTS/E operating system software. He broke into DEC's computer network and
                            copied
                            the
                            company's software, a crime for which he was charged and convicted in 1988. He was sentenced
                            to
                            12
                            months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Near the end of his
                            supervised
                            release, Mitnick hacked into Pacific Bell voicemail computers. After a warrant was issued
                            for
                            his
                            arrest, Mitnick fled, becoming a fugitive for two-and-a-half years.</p>

                        is a Scottish systems administrator and hacker who
                        was accused in 2002 of perpetrating the "biggest military computer hack of all time",
                        although McKinnon himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of free energy
                        suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity and other technologies potentially useful to the
                        public. On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, then Home
                        Secretary Theresa May blocked extradition to the United States.</p>

                    <h2>Hacking History:</h2>
                    <p>McKinnon was accused of hacking into 97 United States military and NASA computers over a
                        13-month period between February 2001 and March 2002, at the house of his girlfriend's aunt
                        in London, using the name 'Solo'.</p>
                    <p>US authorities stated he deleted critical files from operating systems, which shut down the
                        United States Army's Military District of Washington network of 2000 computers for 24 hours.
                        McKinnon also posted a notice on the military's website: "Your security is crap". After the
                        September 11 attacks in 2001, he allegedly deleted weapons logs at the Earle Naval Weapons
                        Station, rendering its network of 300 computers inoperable and paralyzing munitions supply
                        deliveries for the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet. McKinnon was also accused of copying data,
                        account files and passwords onto his own computer. US authorities stated that the cost of
                        tracking and correcting the problems he caused was over $700,000.</p>
                    <p>While not admitting that it constituted evidence of destruction, McKinnon did admit leaving a
                        threat on one computer:
                        US foreign policy is akin to Government-sponsored terrorism these days ... It was not a
                        mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September 11 last year ... I am SOLO. I
                        will continue to disrupt at the highest levels

                <img src="./img/black.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="Black Hat" />
                <p>
                    A black hat hacker is a cybercriminal who breaks into computer systems with malicious or criminal
                    intent. Black hat hackers are probably what you think of when you picture a typical hacker or
                    cybercriminal. Their advanced technical knowledge and ability to navigate the cybersecurity
                    landscape is what makes them so skilled in carrying out their attacks. They go out of their way to
                    find vulnerabilities in computer systems and software, which they exploit for financial gain or
                    other malicious purposes.

                    These individuals can do serious harm to individuals and organizations alike by stealing sensitive
                    or personal data, compromising entire computer systems, or altering critical networks.
                </p>

            <div class="tab-panel" id="white">
                <h3>White Hat: Authorized Hackers</h3>
                <img src="./img/white.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="White Hat" />
                <p>Similar to black hat hackers, white hat hackers are cybersecurity experts who use their skills to
                    find vulnerabilities in organizational networks and computer systems. The key difference between
                    them, however, is that white hat hackers are authorized to hack these systems for the purpose of
                    spotting security vulnerabilities before a criminal hacker can.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-panel" id="grey">
                <h3>Grey Hat: "Just for Fun" Hackers</h3>
                <img src="./img/grey.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="Grey Hat" />
                <p>A grey hat hacker is a cybersecurity expert who finds ways to hack into computer networks and
                    systems, but without the malicious intent of a black hat hacker.

                    Typically, they engage in hacking activities for the pure enjoyment of finding gaps in computer
                    systems, and they might even let the owner know if any weak points are found. However, they don’t
                    always take the most ethical route when employing their hacking activities—they may penetrate
                    systems or networks without the owner’s permission (even though they aren’t trying to cause any
                    harm).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-panel" id="red">
                <h3>Red Hat: Government-Hired Hackers</h3>
                <img src="./img/red.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="Red Hat" />
                <p>Red hat hackers are hired by government agencies to spot vulnerabilities in security systems, with a
                    specific focus on finding and disarming black hat hackers. They’re known to be particularly ruthless
                    in their hunt for black hat criminals, and typically use any means possible to take them down. This
                    often looks like using the same tactics as black hat hackers and using them against them—using the
                    same malware, viruses and other strategies to compromise their machines from the inside out.</p>

                <h3>Green Hat: Hackers-in-Training</h3>
                <img src="./img/green.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="Green Hat" />
                <p>A green hat hacker is someone who is new to the hacking world but is intently focused on increasing
                    their cyberattack skills. They primarily focus on gaining knowledge on how to perform cyberattacks
                    on the same level as their black hat counterparts. Their main intent is to eventually evolve into a
                    full-fledged hacker, so they spend their time looking for learning opportunities from more
                    experienced hackers.
